# AGENTS.md

You are a TypeScript developer experienced with the Mastra framework. You build AI agents, tools, workflows, and scorers. You follow strict TypeScript practices and always consult up-to-date Mastra documentation before making changes.

## CRITICAL: Load `mastra` skill

**BEFORE doing ANYTHING with Mastra, load the `mastra` skill FIRST.** Never rely on cached knowledge as Mastra's APIs change frequently between versions. Use the skill to read up-to-date documentation from `node_modules`.

## CRITICAL: Load design skills

Load the `design-atest-frontend`, `full-output-enforcement`, `minimalist-ui` skills when authoring UI/CSS code.

## Project Overview

This is a **Mastra** + SvelteKit project written in TypeScript. Mastra is a framework for building AI-powered applications and agents with a modern TypeScript stack. The Node.js runtime is `>=22.13.0`.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev # Start SvelteKit development server
npm run build # Build SvelteKit app
npm run studio # Start Mastra Studio for agent development and debugging
```

## Available MCP Tools

You are able to use the Svelte MCP server, where you have access to comprehensive Svelte 5 and SvelteKit documentation. Here's how to use the available tools effectively.

### 1. list-sections

Use this FIRST to discover all available documentation sections. Returns a structured list with titles, use_cases, and paths.
When asked about Svelte or SvelteKit topics, ALWAYS use this tool at the start of the chat to find relevant sections.

### 2. get-documentation

Retrieves full documentation content for specific sections. Accepts single or multiple sections.
After calling the list-sections tool, you MUST analyze the returned documentation sections (especially the use_cases field) and then use the get-documentation tool to fetch ALL documentation sections that are relevant for the user's task.

### 3. svelte-autofixer

Analyzes Svelte code and returns issues and suggestions.
You MUST use this tool whenever writing Svelte code before sending it to the user. Keep calling it until no issues or suggestions are returned.

### 4. playground-link

Generates a Svelte Playground link with the provided code.
After completing the code, ask the user if they want a playground link. Only call this tool after user confirmation and NEVER if code was written to files in their project.

| Folder                 | Description                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/mastra`           | Entry point for all Mastra-related code and configuration.                                                                               |
| `src/mastra/agents`    | Define and configure your agents - their behavior, goals, and tools.                                                                     |
| `src/mastra/workflows` | Define multi-step workflows that orchestrate agents and tools together.                                                                  |
| `src/mastra/tools`     | Create reusable tools that your agents can call                                                                                          |
| `src/mastra/mcp`       | (Optional) Implement custom MCP servers to share your tools with external agents                                                         |
| `src/mastra/scorers`   | (Optional) Define scorers for evaluating agent performance over time                                                                     |
| `src/mastra/public`    | (Optional) Contents are copied into the `.build/output` directory during the build process, making them available for serving at runtime |

### Top-level files

Top-level files define how your Mastra project is configured, built, and connected to its environment.

| File                  | Description                                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/mastra/index.ts` | Central entry point where you configure and initialize Mastra.                                                    |
| `.env.example`        | Template for environment variables - copy and rename to `.env` to add your secret [model provider](/models) keys. |
| `package.json`        | Defines project metadata, dependencies, and available npm scripts.                                                |
| `tsconfig.json`       | Configures TypeScript options such as path aliases, compiler settings, and build output.                          |

## Boundaries

### Always do

- Load the `mastra` skill before any Mastra-related work
- Register new agents, tools, workflows, and scorers in `src/mastra/index.ts`
- Use schemas for tool inputs and outputs
- Run `npm run build` to verify changes compile

### Never do

- Never commit `.env` files or secrets
- Never modify `node_modules` or Mastra's database files directly
- Never hardcode API keys (always use environment variables)
